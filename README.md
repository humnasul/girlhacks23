## Galactic Savings  
You save it, we plan-et! Galactic Savings is a financial app that helps users keep track of and take advantage of their spendings and savings! You can enter goals, view transactions, and more!  

**technologies used:**
- StreamLit: we decided to use Python to code a website and include data visualizations
- Data analysis using SQL (mySQL, SQLite) + databases
- HTML, JSS, JavaScript
- Python library integration
- Graph + data manipulation
- Multi-page website  

**Planning:**
Our original idea was to primarily use StreamLit, and in the end, we transferred over to using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This repository includes files from both implementations - both are incomplete due to time restrictions
